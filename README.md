 In this repo, there is a program that controls the computer by detecting hand movements with Python. Using libraries such as MediaPipe and Selenium, it pulls data from the Internet, detects hand movements in real time and transforms them into various operations. You can perform operations such as automatic mail sending, volume control and ready-made desktop templates. For an interactive experience, watch my video and control your computer with your hand gestures with Python.
